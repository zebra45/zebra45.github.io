             I thought it would be cool to try a QR code card this year. I made the webpage you are currently looking at on my cloud server. I hope it all worked out. 
             Just wanted to say that I am so glad to be spending 
             Christmas with the best Dad EVER!! I have really missed you these past few months, especially ours hugs. And I am so happy to making up some 
             of that time this winter break. Of course I don't need to say any of this because we think so similarly that you already know what I think. 
             But still I want to say that you and Mom mean the world to me.
             <br>
             Love you more than you can even imagine,
             <br>
